High-throughput gene expression profiling technologies such as DNA microarrays and RNA sequencing have become important microbiological tools. Their power and popularity come from their ability to make a large number of simultaneous measurements. Such technologies allow the measurement of tens of thousands of gene expressions. This gives biologists a high-level view of genome activity as well as allowing investigation of individual genes. While these profiling techniques have proven to be invaluable tools their analyses are not without caveats. One issue which confounds gene expression profiling is sample heterogeneity. 

Profiling techniques measure gene expression of a sample. A sample is simply a collection of cells. These cells typically are cultivated from animal tissue, for example, a rat tumor biopsy or human blood titer. The gene expressions measured reflect the average gene expression across cells in the sample. Thus, for a sample consisting of precisely one cell type the measurements typify a gene expression profile for that type. However, for a heterogeneous sample of several cell types the measured expressions are not as interpretable. In this case the measurements will be a convolution of the expression profiles from the constituent types. 

The convoluted nature of heterogeneous data makes comparing expression measurements across samples difficult. It becomes necessary to determine if changes in measurements come from genuine expression changes in cells or from compositional changes affecting the samples' mixing proportions. More to the point, it is often of interest to analyze expression changes in individual cell types and not a mixture thereof. Unfortunately heterogeneous samples are the rule not the exception and comparative analyses, like differential expression analysis, are a primary application of interest.

Accordingly, researchers have two goals when dealing with heterogeneous data. First, they would like to remove any confounding effects of sample heterogeneity. Secondly, they want to be able to get cell subtype specific gene expression profiles. Methods to these ends are called \emph{cell type deconvolution}. Solutions have been pioneered at both the physical cell sample level and data analytic level. Physical techniques like flow cytometry attempt to solve the heterogeneity problems by sorting cells into their respective types before analysis is performed. These techniques are employed to purify heterogeneous samples into homogeneous ones allowing researchers to be sure that the final samples analyzed contain only one cell type. However these techniques are expensive, time intensive and have been noted to change gene expression. Thus, in lieu of physical methods, there is ample room for data analytical techniques to deconvolve expression signal from heterogeneous samples.
